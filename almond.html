        <h3>Almond</h3>
        <p><br><b>Benefits of Almond Oil for Hair</b><br>

            <br>If you've ever suffered from a dry scalp, split ends, scalp psoriasis or the hundred other results of environmental stress that can leave your strands stressed out,
            you might be familiar with the idea of adding oil to your hair. Natural oil can support the health of your hair follicles and deliver essential nutrients, 
            and sweet almond oil is one of the best oils for hair health.<br>

            <br>How Almond Oil Supports Your Strands<br>
            <br>Produced from ripe almonds picked from the almond tree, almond oil is an excellent hair oil to soothe dry hair and improve scalp health, 
            reducing the appearance of flaky skin. It's easy to find in any health food store and is both friendly on your wallet and healthy for your hair.
            "Almond oil has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for hair health and styling," explained organic skincare expert Blanca Aguirrezabal. 
            "It is packed with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that can help to protect the hair from damage and help to nurture it."
            Packed with riboflavin, magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin E, almonds have long been a nutritional mainstay for the health-focused. And it turns out the oil is as good for your strands as the nuts are for your body!<br>
